# odin-recipes

brief introduction describing what the current project is and what skills you will have demonstrated once you have completed it. (You can also do this as a self-reflection at the end of the project, which is a good way to review what you have learned.)

remember to use:

git status
git add
git commit -m "lalala and lalala"
git push origin main


to send changes to GitHub


I'm not sure what's up with git commits after I changed the names of the folders, so I renamed them back to see what I can do.
